# SIMULATOR
of something, idk of what for now :(
For now I'm trying to create a clean vulkan abstraction for the renderer :)

## before setup
 - Make sure you have intalled cmake version 3.16 or later
 - Vulkan SDK should be installed under C:/VulkanSDK. If the path is different, open file Renderer/VulkanSDK.cmake and edit it appropriately.

## setup
 - run cmake-gen.bat
